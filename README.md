HackTech project by: Michael Zemsky, Sebastian Sarbora, Robert Rouhani, and Jazmine Olinger


ArtPress is hardware/software hack to create a virtual combination of music and art.

We have assembled custom hardware in the form of a bluetooth controlled led wristband, an Infrared Point Glove, and an Infrared detection camera.

The Led Wristband uses software written in Processing to visualize music based on beat detection. It has two physical modes:

Band mode wraps around your wrist and becomes a bright color representation of your music.

Paint Brush Mode moves the band into a stiff stick so that It can be used to draw your music onto live video from a webcam, Similar to the concept of long exposure light graffiti.

The IR Point Glove and IR Camera are used in conjunction to accurately find the users hand in 3d space. With this, and the communication provided by the LED band bluetooth allow you to draw 3d voxels on screen, creating a 3d model. This model pulsates with the same colors as the music visualizer.
